# Universal-Search for the Domain Medicine
Universal Search for Medicine is a web tool for smart searching the domain of Medicine. 
Text input is needed once, this text input is used in 100 search strings, mainly
through google. The search strings are collected in a matrix, which combine different
parts of the medical domain.

For patients the best search strings are f.e. in Signs & Symptoms 'Need a Doctor?' or
'Red Falgs', the list 'Baby | Child | Adolescent | Adults | Women | Elderly' or 
go to 'General Information' and click 'Guidelines' and 'Wikepedia'.

If you want to use different languages just type french or german or other language,
and you will be directed to sites in that language.

If the tool is opened in your browser: Please drop a note by clicking the text at the bottom.

5. Click index.html
6. Resize the browser to ablout 50 of screen width and 90% of height
7. Start and open the searches

# How to use optimal screen settings?

2. Open index.html, if window is part of screen continue at ..
3. Open index.html, if window full screen:
    - Click on right upper conrner window icon to make window smaller
    - Enter f.e. Fever, submit/I agree: you will open the matrix window
    - Then, click on f.e. signs & symptoms; this opens new Tab

# How to place the UMS on your PC or iPad
You now need to run it locally as a static site instead of expecting GitHub to “open” index.html directly in the browser.

Why it no longer opens directly

GitHub no longer serves raw HTML as a live web page from the repository view; clicking index.html shows the file content, not a running page.

Easiest solution: download and open locally

Steps on Windows (your current workflow):

a. Go to the repo: 
https://github.com/hanshendrickx/UMS
.
b. Click the green Code button → Download ZIP.
c. Save the ZIP (e.g., Desktop), then right‑click → Extract All….
d. Open the extracted folder UMS-master (or similar).
e. Double‑click index.html to open it in your default browser.
f. If nothing happens, right‑click index.html → Open with → choose Chrome/Edge/Firefox.

This reproduces the “old” behavior: you have the matrix and all links working locally.

Option 2: use GitHub Pages (online view again)

If you want to view it online again without downloading:

a. Log in to GitHub and go to the UMS repository settings.
b. In Pages (left sidebar), set:

Source: Deploy from a branch

Branch: master (or main) and folder /root.
c. Save; after a minute GitHub will give you a URL like https://hanshendrickx.github.io/UMS.
d. Open that URL; it will serve index.html as a web page again.

If you tell me where exactly it “stops working” (e.g., “clicking index.html now only shows code”), I can adjust these steps to your exact browser/Windows 10 setup.
